## Exercise - Adding a state

Implement a state to manage the list of products and enable product deletion.


1. Import the `useState` hook from React.
2. Initialize the `products` state using `useState()` within the `ProductList` component.
3. Update the `products` state when a product is removed using the `removeItem` function.
4. Pass the `removeItem` function to each `Product` component as a prop.
5. Handle the `onClick` event of the `‚ùå` button in the `Product` component to invoke the `removeItem` prop function.
