## Exercise - First component

Create your first component: HelloWorld.

- Open `main.jsx` (it's the main file, it is loaded in `index.html:10`)
- Create a new component named `HelloWorld`. This component should render text "Hello World"
- Use `ReactDOM.createRoot` to render this component into the element with the id `root`

Go to http://localhost:5173/, and check that your component is rendered
