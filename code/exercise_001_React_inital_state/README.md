## React course exercise

### Setup

- Install **Node**, eg using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
- To scalfold the project, we chose to use [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
  ```shell
  npm create vite@latest hiquea --template react-ts
  ```
- We recommend to install [VS Code ESLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) as we have defined some rules.
  - Or you can run it manually by running `npm run lint`

### Presentation

In this exercise, we will be exploring React.

Let's have a look at the existing code...

- This repository contains the start of the student app.
- Import the application in your IDE
- Install the dependencies of the application by running `npm install`
- Run the application by execusting `npm run dev` in the
  folder `code` in the project.
- Browse to http://localhost:5173/. What do you see?

Now that we have taken our first step in React, let's
move to the first exercise by executing
`cmtc next-exercise <path to course root folder>`
