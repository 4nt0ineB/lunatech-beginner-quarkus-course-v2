## Exercise - Passing props

This exercise aims to transform the file into a React application that displays a list of products.

- In the `main` file, create a new component called `Product`. This component should take in two props, `name` and `price`, and render them within a `<div>`.
- Create another component called `ProductList`. This component should render a list of `Product` components.
- Add four instances of the `Product` component within `ProductList`, each with a unique name and price.
- Replace the rendering of the `HelloWorld` component with the `ProductList` component.
- Ensure that your application now displays a list of products when the page is loaded.
