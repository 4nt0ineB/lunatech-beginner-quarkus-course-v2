## Exercise 5: Products from the database, using Hibernate + Panache

In this exercise, we will start reading products from the database, rather than from the hardcoded `Products` class. We will use Hibernate + Panache as the ORM, with a Postgres database that we run on Docker using Docker Compose.

* In the root of the student app project, there is a `docker-compose.yml`, which contains a single service; a postgres database.
* Start it up using: `docker-compose up --detach`
* Next, we need to add some extensions. Add the following to your `pom.xml` in the dependencies section:

    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-hibernate-orm-panache</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
      <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
      <artifactId>quarkus-jdbc-postgresql</artifactId>
    </dependency>

* Now we need to tell Quarkus where our database lives. Add the following to your `application.propertiesâ€™:

        quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql
        quarkus.datasource.username=postgres
        quarkus.datasource.password=postgres
        quarkus.datasource.jdbc.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:8765/postgres
        quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation = drop-and-create
  
* Next, make your existing `Product` class extend from `PanacheEntity`, and add an `@Entity` annotation. This makes your `Product` class suitable for _Active Record_-style persistence, where the class you persist has static methods to interact with the storage.
* Add a default constructor, and make the fields non-final. Also, remove the `id` field from Product, since that field is already defined on `PanacheEntity`.
* Delete your old `Products` class, and update your `ProductsResource` to use the static methods on `Product` instead.
* Which methods did you pick?

* Pull in a file `import.sql` by executing the following command in a terminal:

`cmtc pull-template src/main/resources/import.sql <root folder of exercise repo>`.

Hibernate will automatically pick up this file, and execute its contents after creating the database. The file will populate your database with the HIQUEA products we love so much.

* Run your app and check if everything still works :)
